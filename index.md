Hi, welcome to my blog. I'm a student in Cognitive Computational Neuroscience.
My ultimate goal is to understand the existence of myself (Know thyself), 
by studying artificial intelligence, human consciousness, physics and everything I need.
My interests come from the logic in games and the limit of language, leading to the essentials of mind & universe.
I like the experience of beling alive and thinking about thinking, 
but I also like the philosophical motto "nothing is true, everything is permitted" from Assassin's Creed.

Hope you find something interesting here and we can contribute to the future a bit (-w -) // **
