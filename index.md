HI!I am an undergraduate student in Computer science and technology at NorthEastern University, China.
Even though I read a lot of books, but there is no Achievements to show, regrettably...((/- -)/ 
However, Here still have some interesting things, including deal with the problems in my learning process.
Maybe it can help a little. "Nothing is ture, Everything is permitted." is my favorite motto, 
which contains the independence of thought and freedom of action.
Currently my research interests include Neural Science, Artificial Intelligence and Brain research.
I will very glad to receive your Messages.Haha! (-w -) // **
